# About Me

I'm a sixth year Applied Mathematics graduate student at Northwestern University. My work has mainly focused on deep learning classification algorithms for temporal data. Much of my recent work has been focused on extensions of LSTMs to complex datasets. I have developed algorithms to improve classification of both imbalanced datasets and partially ordered time series data. 

In addition to my work in machine learning, I'm involved with Northwestern Splash, an educational outreach program where college students teach one off classes to local high school students on topics that range from cryptography to german wheel to east coast swing. Our program is supported by the Learning Unlimited, the national umbrella organization. 

# Current Research Focus

## Reconstructing the Large Scale Structure of the Universe

The distribution of matter in the universe holds a wealth of information about the fundemental nature of the cosmos. As time moves forward, structure evolve under the force of gravity given their initial conditions from the early universe. By understanding the current distributon of matter, we can rewind back time to study the initial conditions as well as constrain the gravitational evolution itself. 

Some of my recent work has been focused on understanding the emergent structures in the universe from a variety of cosmological probes using maximum likelihood methods.

## Unstanding the Structure of the Universe through the Cosmic Microwave Background

The Cosmic Microwave Background provides a backlight on universe and we can analyze structures not only through the radiation they emit but through the interaction of the matter with light from the cosmic microwave background. This has the advantege of allowing us to analyze aspects of galaxy clusters that cannot be inferred from the visible light, such as the temperature of the intracluster medium (through the thermal Sunyaev Zeldovich effect) or the overall mass of the cluster (through their gravitational lensing).

## Exploring Cosmological Signatures of Beyond the Standard Model Physics

Perhaps the most exciting aspect of modern cosmology is the ability to use the large datasets available to constrain exotic physics models. Of particular interest recently has been the theory that dark matter is composed primarily (or exclusively) from a large primordial black hole population. In this work, I used observations from the Planck Satellite's observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background to constrain those models.
